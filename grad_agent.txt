2. The Vision: A Quick Example of the User Story & Acceptance Criteria
● Target User Persona:
A Googler preparing for the annual performance cycle or quarterly check-in
A manager setting expectations for themselves and their team
● User's Request:
“I need to draft my expectations and OKRs for this year. Can you help me make sure
they’re SMART, foster teamwork, and align with our org’s frameworks and Google’s
values? Please ensure my expectations are also grounded in the responsibilities, scope,
and impact outlined in my role profile.”
● Ideal Agent Response (Acceptance Criteria):
“Absolutely! Let’s draft your first expectation together, ensuring it is:
- SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
- Grounded in your role profile (scope, responsibilities, and significant impact for
your level)
- Supportive of teamwork (welcoming environment, dependability, collaboration)
- Aligned with your org’s frameworks and Google’s values
Here’s a draft based on your role profile and your org’s guiding frameworks:
Expectation (E1):
Lead the launch of Project Atlas, collaborating across product, engineering, and marketing
teams to deliver on Q3 business goals, while fostering a welcoming and dependable team
environment.
Key Steps:
1. Finalize cross-functional requirements by March 15 (Specific, Time-bound)
2. Coordinate weekly syncs to ensure open communication and support among
teammates (Measurable, Achievable)
3. Achieve launch milestone by July 1 (Time-bound, Relevant)
4. Share post-launch learnings and best practices with the broader team (Relevant,
Achievable)
5. [Optional] Develop stakeholder management skills as part of this project
(Development Opportunity)
- Category: Team priorities (directly tied to org OKRs)
- Status: Active
- Teamwork Attributes: Foster a welcoming environment, be a dependable
teammate, collaborate effectively
- Role Profile Reference: This expectation is calibrated for significant impact (S)
and aligns with your responsibilities and scope as outlined in your role profile.
- Org Framework Reference: [Org’s guiding framework name or principle]
- Values Alignment: Adheres to Google’s Code of Conduct and hybrid work
approach
Would you like to:
- Add a stretch goal or comment on how you plan to go above and beyond
baseline expectations?
- Include a new skill or teamwork attribute you want to develop?
- Draft additional expectations based on other areas of your role profile or org
priorities?”
● Example of a Poor/Failed Response:
“Please enter your expectations.” (No SMART guidance, teamwork focus, or values
alignment.)

profile, team goals, org frameworks, or previous cycles
